Spring Social PayPal
====================

Spring Social PayPal is a Spring Social extension that provides support for the [PayPal Access API]. Currently, this extension supports log in using a PayPal identity, and retrieval of the user's profile (such as name, address, telephone number, etc...)

To get started, first check-out the Spring Social PayPal Quickstart sample project:
